## RootStateSelectors type

Represents a mapping of selectors for each key in a given root state.

This type is a utility that takes a root state object type and generates a corresponding set of selectors. Each selector is associated with a key in the root state, allowing for the selection of specific parts of the state.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type RootStateSelectors<RootState = any> = {
    [Key in keyof RootState]: Selector<RootState, RootState[Key], []>;
};
```
